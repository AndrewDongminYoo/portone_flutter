```dart

import 'package:portone_flutter_v2/portone_flutter_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const PaymentScreen({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create payment request
    final paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(
      storeId: 'your_store_id',  // PortOne store ID
      paymentId: 'order_12345',  // Your unique order ID
      orderName: 'Premium Subscription',
      totalAmount: 10000,
      currency: PaymentCurrency.krw,
      payMethod: PaymentPayMethod.card,
      appScheme: 'yourappscheme',  // Your app's URL scheme
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Payment')),
      body: PortonePayment(
        data: paymentRequest,
        initialChild: const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
        callback: (result) {
          // Handle successful payment
          print('Payment successful: ${result.toJson()}');
          Navigator.pop(context, result);
        },
        onError: (error) {
          // Handle payment error
          print('Payment error: $error');
          Navigator.pop(context, null);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

### Handling Payment Response

```dart
// Navigate to payment screen and wait for result
final result = await Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const PaymentScreen()),
);

if (result != null) {
  // Payment was successful
  final response = result as PaymentResponse;
  // Process successful payment
} else {
  // Payment failed or was cancelled
}

```
